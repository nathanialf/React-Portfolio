Hi!

~~I'm Nathan. I am a variety of engineer titles based on what project I am working on. Most of my career I aligned with the DevOps Engineer title, while I was employed under a System Development Engineer. I went to school to be Software Engineer.~~

I'm Nathan. I am a person; presumably you are too if you care about reading this. I have had some trouble defining who I am without a full-time job for the first time of my adult life. The scratched out bit is the first draft of my opening. It's not great and still shows that I am not through this. That said, I am an engineer and I do like working on software. I love video games and play them extensively during the happy parts of my life. I love the collaboration between art, technology and business decisions to make experiences that get to live exclusively through interaction. I yearn to absorb as much of the creativity that erupts when they all mix together. Hopefully without sounding too monotonous, I also love movies and I also love traveling. I got married last year to my wonderful wife who I do not deserve, though she would argue against that statement (which is another reason why I adore her).

I not-so-recently (May 2025) left my job at Amazon after 5 years there, after I stopped having the opportunities I needed. I took time to evaluate myself and the industry. In the next chapter of my life, I want to define myself as a couple of different things. The difference now is that I want clearer boundaries to make my work-life balance better and more well-rounded.

First, I want to define myself as a freelance software engineer in the Tech industry. That includes as much or as little as the project requires. Software architecting, DevOps, writing more code than I ever did when I was a full-time employee anywhere. I have some pretty strong opinions about the current job market and *gestures vaguely at* everything but I do want to leave that to another post. In these past few months, I found a partner to build a product called MySeatMap that we are launching later this month. MySeatMap is a product to help airline employees use their non-rev tickets or keep an eye on the standby queue without going to the airport and wasting several hours. After launch I want to write a blog post about what my thought process was in how I architected, failures I made, goals and how I achieved them. I am not against going back to another company as an Engineer but I have reservations about the industry. As I have been interviewing since I left, a recurring theme is disappointingly that "there isn't room for growth" straight from the horse's mouths.

Next, I want to define myself in the Games Industry. At Amazon, I worked for 3 years in AWS GameTech shutting down two separate services, both named GameSparks. What this taught me, that I didn't know at the time, was that I wanted to be more involved in project management, specifically as a TPM or a Producer. Being in the games industry is why I got into tech. I was learning to program when I got *Halo: Reach*, fell in love with it, and the combined passion became my career goal. GameTech was the only space I wanted to work in at Amazon and felt privileged to do so at the time. I was gutted when I had to leave. Again, another post I want to write.

Lastly, I love to travel and want to define myself by experiencing different environments and cultures. Mostly I just want to vibe and eat. So I will probably show some photos I took while traveling or fawning over restaurants I loved. Though these may just be posts on BlueSky (you can follow me at [@defnf.com](https://bsky.app/profile/defnf.com)! I am trying to post more too!)

As this is an introduction to me as a person rather than just the work I am doing, this is fundamentally a roadmap of blog posts I've been mulling over. Posts I've ideated as I evaluate my career and where I can find meaning in work and life. It's also a way for me to separate my value as a person from the positions I held.

To recap, here's what to expect in the short to medium term from me on this blog:
- MySeatMap Launch Post-Mortem
- Amazon and the Games Industry
- Bay Area Tech Job Market, A Perspective
- Sycophancy and You! (The you you want to be) (Definitely not a self-help blog, I am not qualified for that) (I didn't mention this one previously!) (Parenthesis) (Working Title)
- Video game impressions/reviews

Here's what to expect from me in terms of software:
- MySeatMap Launch
- Cartograph (Working Title), a documentation generation service
- Syndicate, an RSS reader app I haven't published purely because getting testers isn't very fun
- I want to participate in my first game jam (specifically as a producer)
- Some smaller game dev "sketches" to catch vibes of game specifics I love and to commit to manageable scope
- Hopefully freelance work

A last point I want to address is that I don't want to write posts to be LinkedIn bait or something AI generated to get free internet points. I unfortunately need editing because I am not a good writer and will have either my wife or an LLM proofread these posts. I will not let either write anything for me because I need to maintain my voice more than anything. If anything, my writing goal is to do something an AI can't possibly do. From one of my favorite movies, *The French Dispatch of the Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun*: "Just try to make it sound like you wrote it that way on purpose." I don't want to make any claims that my writing will be good for a while, though.
